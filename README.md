# 👩‍💻 My Portfolio Website

Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio!
This website highlights my technical journey,
the skills I've developed, the projects I've completed,
and a bit about who I am. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
I built this portfolio as a reflection of my growth as a developer,
and I look forward to continuously updating it as I advance on my technical journey.
